To run the app you should run "npm install" then the "npm start" should build the app and also open live React server

I've used MaterialUI to spead up the design part as I wanted to focus more on the functionality itself and also Axios to fetch the data from PokeAPI.

My biggest challange was to make the pagination working also with the Favourites that user can add but after checking other people solution how to create something simillar I've managed to do this.

If I had more time I'll try to complete it fully as I didn't manage to give the functionality to see the details about Pokemon and to Compare them as I've never done this before and I'll take a lot of time to complete but I'm still happy with what I've completed.
